## 💡 Why It’s a GenAI Project

GenAI isn't just about chatbots — it's about generating human-like responses, solutions, or outputs based on given context.  This project uses:

1. Natural language processing (via Cohere)

2. Context embedding (sampled Excel data)

3. Language→Logic translation (generate/explain formulas)➡️ Making it a textbook example of a GenAI-powered analytics assistant.
